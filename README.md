## This repo includes 4 Notebooks:
## 1. Random Forest Prediction with TF-IDF vectorizer.
## 2. Random Forest with pre-trained Word2Vec embedding and imblearn SMOTE oversampling.
## 3. Random Forest with imblearn undersampling methods
## 4. CNN/Bidirectional LSTM neural network Prediction.
## Applied NLP Augmentation for minority classes and compared result with original data.
## Reduced majority class sample size and compared result with original data result.
