# NLP-Multilabels-Classification-Prediction-with-Imbalance-Data
### This is a current real world NLP problem from a finacial company. The data has 11 categories which is from MarletteFunding. I provided solutions from classic ML to Nueral Network and BERT, implemented NLP augmentation, SMOTE etc, techniques to solve multi-class problem with imbalance data. It includes 6 Notebooks:
* 1. Random Forest Prediction with TF-IDF vectorizer.
* 2. Random Forest prediction with pre-trained Word2Vec embedding and imblearn SMOTE oversampling.
* 3. Random Forest prediction with imblearn undersampling methods.
* 4. CNN/BiLSTM model with NLP Augmentation.
* 5. CNN/BiLSTM, ANN, BERT models and comparison with their performance.
* 6. Small BERT (2 hidden layers) and BERT_Base (12 hidden layers) with model trainable = True. BERT_Base reached best prediction acc 0.90.
* Applied NLP Augmentation and SMOTE technique for minority classes and compared result with original data.
* Undersampling majority class with NearMiss etc. techniques and compared result with original data result.
* Bert outperformance to CNN/BiLSTM and ANN models.
