## NLP-Multilabels-Prediction-with-Imbalance-Data
### This repo is to find solutions for NLP multilabels with imbalance data problem. It includes 4 Notebooks:
### 1. Random Forest Prediction with TF-IDF vectorizer.
### 2. Random Forest prediction with pre-trained Word2Vec embedding and imblearn SMOTE oversampling.
### 3. Random Forest prediction with imblearn undersampling methods.
### 4. CNN/BiLSTM model with NLP Augmentation.
### 5. CNN/BiLSTM, ANN, BERT models and comparison with their performance.
### Applied NLP Augmentation for minority classes and compared result with original data.
### Reduced majority class sample size and compared result with original data result.
### Bert outperformance CNN/BiLSTM and ANN models.
